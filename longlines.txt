a quick test to confirm I am not just copying the same line over and over  line 1: a very long line that should end in a while so that I can check if this function is capable of reading more than is's desigated buffer size and still give the whole line without any problems nor taking too much time, I have no clue how long I will make this but I hope this will be long enough to convince you that this works even for long lines and not just for a simple text with well defined line length.

a very long line that should end in a while so that I can check if this function is capable of reading more than is's desigated buffer size and still give the whole line without any problems nor taking too much time, I have no clue how long I will make this but I hope this will be long enough to convince you that this works even for long lines and not just for a simple text with well defined line length. If you want to test more lines that are similar in length to this one you should try to pass the longlines.txt files this line will be copied and pasted multiple times in there
